Implement a simple version of rock/paper/scissors, using a typescript backend with
the following functionality:

It receives a message, which it parses as "rock", "paper," or "scissors." It then
waits for a second message which it parses the same way. It communicates to the senders
of _both_ messages what the values of the first and the second messages were. It then
resets the state so that more games can be played.

Note that players do not know whether they are player 1 or player 2 and should not have
to identify themselves as such.

1. Define the database schema
2. What is the structure of the API
3. Implement using either typescript of python
